This was my first time playing with Angular and guess what I learned?

It's awesome. Especially for e-commerce! 

In this tutorial, I'll cover:

* Updates on Angular v8.0
* Angular for e-commerce 
* Sanity as a headless CMS
* Setting up a new Sanity CMS instance
* Setting up Netlify for deployment and use Netlify functions to expose our data from Sanity
* Building an Angular app with appropriate components to display storefront

The result will be a fully decoupled  [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/)  e-commerce bundle.
